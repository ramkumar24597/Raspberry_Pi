here in this project we have done the serial communication between arduino and raspberry pi 
talk about the gas sensor value through it

then we have used the matplotlib library to plot the value of the sensor to plot the graph

milestones seen:
first the bar graph generation 
then real time monitoring so we used animation in matplot lib to animate the graph for real time animation (understand the inbuilt functions of the animation)
Self function to get the serial communication value automatically or self process

problems faced:

zip function arguments must be an iteratable one
global declaration of variables
