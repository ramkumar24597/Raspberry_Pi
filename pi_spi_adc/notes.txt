good to see you

here in this project i have interfaced the mcp3008(adc) with raspberry pi to get the analog inputs
for that i have used the spi_communication protocol

I will explain what are the things u should have to do for working with spi

1. u must have to know about the datasheet of the slave(mcp3004)
2. raspberry pi pin conf
3. about spi

spi is a serial peripheral interface communication protocol used to communicaate between the device,but
unlike i2c it has only one master,but its one of the high speed comm protocol
cannot used for long distance , because loss of data may occur

then slaves datasheet, each slave has it one spi conf, it will be specified in the datasheet, you can 
communicate between slave only if u knows about the slave conf
eg: about no.of.instruction bits req, and bit order, and no. of data bits and its order,etc

here mcp3008 has 5 bit instruction start,sig/diff,d2,d1,d0
d - represents the channel address
d2 d1 d0   channel
0  0  0      0
0  0  1      1
0  1  0      2
0  1  1      3
1  0  0      4
1  0  1      5
1  1  0      6
1  1  1      7

likewise

thank you
